# Water-Ultra-Filtration-Membrane-RUL-Prediction
Use of transformer model that is a neural network architecture based on the multi-head attention mechanism. Prediction of RUL for ultrafiltration membrane based on key parameters from the water industry. Key parameters types includes: water quality (eg: pH, Turbidity, conductivity_uS_cm), weather elements such as rainfall intensity and humidity etc
